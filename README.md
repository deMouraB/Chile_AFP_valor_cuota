# Chile_AFP_valor_cuota
Superintendencia de Pensiones - Gobierno de Chile publishes daily data of share values for each pension fund in the AFP system [https://www.spensiones.cl/apps/valoresCuotaFondo/vcfAFP.php]. This data comes in an untractable format: .csv file with multiple matrices, one per period, with irregular breaks. I wrote some code to format the data and make it readable + usable for data analysis. 
I wrote this code because I spoke to several people who had taken time to modify the .csv files in excel. One such person had done this several times, as the data was updated. I hope that this helps you avoid wasting your time.
